After everything.

JBoss Forge has some plug-ins for making it easy to quickly add the Maven plug-ins
we need to use:
$ cd hola-springboot
$ forge

#Now letâ€™s install a JBoss Forge addon:
$ addon-install --coordinate io.fabric8.forge:devops,2.2.148
***SUCCESS*** Addon io.fa

#Maven plug-ins:
$ fabric8-setup
***SUCCESS*** Added Fabric8 Maven support with base Docker image: fabric8/java-jboss-openjdk8-jdk:1.0.10. 
Added the following Maven profiles [f8-build, f8-deploy, f8-local-deploy] to make building the project easier, e.g., mvn -Pf8-local-deploy
